/*
 * TODO:
 *   - bikesheding
 *      o struct timekeep naming (deraadt@)
 *      o AT_TIMEKEEP at 2000 (kettenis@)
 *   - high resolution time sources (deraadt@)
 *      o CLOCK_MONOTONIC -> nanouptime -> binuptime -> bintemaddfrac
 *        -> tc_delta(th) reproduce in userland (kettenis@)
 *      o requires: bintime exposure and curcpu()->skew
 *
 * FIXED:
 *   - /sbin/init init_main.c!start_init() map page? (deraadt@)
 *      -> not there, the page should be mapped by sys_execve() call
 *   - find_timekeep() called 3 times, call only once (deraadt@)
 *   - atomic read time (deraadt@)
 *      o generation mechanism like the timehands (kettenis@)
 *        SOLUTION:
 *           kernel: gen mechanism is already used by the functions called,
 *           added seq timekeep counter
 *           user: added gen-based mechanism based on seq
 *        PROBLEMS:
 *           might need to change after high-res clock addition...
 *   - versioning mechanism for shared page (kettenis@)
 *      o s.t. libc can verify it understands the kernel iface
 *      o major/minor at the start of the page
 *      o if version check fails -> fallback to system call
 *   - structure may need _ or __ to avoid potential collision (deraadt@)
